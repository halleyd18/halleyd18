- 👋 Hi, I’m @halleyd18
- 👀 I’m interested in regression analysis, SQL, Python, R, Alteryx, and many more! I am currently studying Machine Learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensor flow for Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things involving the automation of data. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at halleyd678@gmail.com. Most of the data I work with is very sensitive, so I am hoping to work with publicly available data!
